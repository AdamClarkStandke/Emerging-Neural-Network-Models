# Graph Neural Networks
[Graph Neural Networks(GNNs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_neural_network#cite_note-:1-43) are a type of neural network architecture that are designed for tasks whose inputs are graphs. I will be implementing various chapters of the book [Hands-On Graph Neural Network Using Python](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Hands-On-Graph-Neural-Networks-Using-Python) written by Maxime Labonne.
